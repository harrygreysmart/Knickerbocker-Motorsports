<h1>Lend a hand</h1>
<p></p>
<p>
  Though we are fortunate enough to have the Mechanical Engineering department and the Activities Board Committee as
  our primary sources of funding, successfully running an Ivy League racing team requires much more than dedicated
  members and the budget we are currently allocated through the University.
  As the costs associated with building a racecar rise and with the economy still struggling, we need your help. Many of
  the expenses we incur are not covered by Columbia University and we rely on our sponsors and our members to help
  fund the team. Any financial contribution to Knickerbocker Motorsports would be highly appreciated and it will allow
  our team to focus our efforts on engineering the best racecar we can.
  It is also important to realize that any donation made either monetary or through gifts and materials are tax
  deductible through Columbia University's 501Â©(3) tax code.

<h1>Ways to donate</h1>
<p></p>

<h4>Online</h4>
<p></p>
<p>
  Columbia University provides an online website to donate. Under School or Division, choose "Engineering and Applied
  Sciences (SEAS), the Fu Foundation School". Under the designation, choose "Other". On the next page, be sure to put
  "Mechanical Engineering - Knickerbocker Motorsports gift" for Comments/Special Instructions. The online process allows
  for both recurring and one-time donations. Recurring donations can even be set to a specific interval of your choice.
  We thank all of our supporters for their continued generosity.
</p>
<p></p>

<h4>Checks By Mail</h4>
<p></p>
<p>
  All checks need to be payable to "Columbia University", with "Knickerbocker Motorsports Gift" written in the memo.
  Make sure that your name and address are on the check to receive tax deductions.
